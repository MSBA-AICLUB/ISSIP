# Criteria and Principles for Evaluating Generative AI Tools

## 1. Fairness:  Diverse Representative Data
**Description**: Evaluate if the AI tool is trained on datasets that include diverse and representative samples from various demographics, cultures, and perspectives.

**Rating Questions**:
- Does the toolâ€™s dataset include a wide range of demographics?
- How does the tool ensure cultural and perspective diversity?
- What methods are used to detect bias in the generated content?
- How effectively are biases mitigated in the AI's output?

**Rating Scale**: 1 (Poor) - 5 (Excellent)

## 2. Prediction Accuracy: Reliability Over Time
**Description**: Determine if the AI tool can consistently generate reliable content over multiple uses.

**Rating Questions**:
- Can prompts be reused to generate similar or identical outputs?
- How does the tool handle variations in prompts?

**Rating Scale**: 1 (Unreliable) - 5 (Highly Reliable)

## 3. Traceability:  Source Attribution & Credit
**Description**: Check if the AI tool provides sources and links for the information used in generating content.

**Rating Questions**:
- Are sources and references provided with the generated content?
- How transparent is the tool about its sources?
- Does the tool provide proper attribution for content?
- How are ownership and rights managed for generated content?

**Rating Scale**: 1 (No Traceability) - 5 (Full Traceability)

## 4. Transparency:  Data Used in Generation
**Description**: Evaluate the transparency of the data and algorithms used in content generation.

**Rating Questions**:
- Is information about the training data available?
- How clear is the documentation regarding the algorithms used?

**Rating Scale**: 1 (Opaque) - 5 (Transparent)

## 5. Privacy & Security: Third-Party Disclosure
**Description**: Assess if the AI tool discloses data to third parties and how data sharing is managed.

**Rating Questions**:
- Does the tool share data with third parties?
- How is user data protected?
