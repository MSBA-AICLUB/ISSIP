# Outlook on Generative AI

This project is part of a collaboration between the [International Society of Service Innovation Professionals](https://www.issip.org) (ISSIP) and [Center of Business Analytics](https://www.tacoma.uw.edu/business/cba)via the Analytics Innovation Club (AI Club) at the University of Washington Tacoma.

## Goals
There are two main goals of this project:
1. Increase **understanding of the various AI tools and their scalability** on the market.
2. Demonstrate how **AI can be a useful service innovation** by generating content for the ISSIP website.

To accomplish this, each person participates in testing three different AI tools. Our goal was to generate **text, images, and video** promoting certain service innovations. 

Once the tools are used to generate the above three generative outputs, each tool is evaluated against 5 **Responsible AI principles**. You can find the detail dive into the [five principles](https://github.com/MSBA-AICLUB/ISSIP/blob/main/EVALUATION_PRINCIPLES.md).

## Documentation
The testing phase was split into three rounds. Each team member have individually performed 2-3 rounds of testing. The following are the Gen AI tools and their respective evalutaion rating. Click the links below to view detailed documentation.

## Rating Scale
Ratings are based on how well each tool generated media from a scale of 0 to 5. 

| Rating | Reasoning                        |
|--------|----------------------------------|
| 0      | Does not generate selected media |
| 1      | Below average performance        |
| 3      | Average performance              |
| 5      | Above average performance        |

## Ethics Rating Scale
Overall ethics rating is roughly averaged from the individual ratings below, to the nearest 0.5 scale.

| Principle                     | Rating (1-5) | Reasoning                                                                   |
